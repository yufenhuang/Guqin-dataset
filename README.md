Guqin dataset (GQ39)
-----------

The Guqin (古琴) is a plucked seven-string Chinese musical instrument existing for over 3,000 years, and has been selected as UNESCO World Cultural Heritage. The GQ39 dataset consists of 39 audio recording clips from 10 prevalent Guqin solo compositions and corresponding note-by-note annotations by experts.


Playing technique annotation
-----------
- **Metadata:** The file “0_piecelist.xlsx” contains the information for audio clips regarding their start time, end time, # of note, mode, and absolute pitch for Gong(宮) in the mode.
- **Score annotations:** The folder “score_annotation” contains note-by-note annotations of 31 musical sections in the scores regarding the note information (degree, range, duration), right-hand techniques (played string, right finger, right-hand playing technique), left-hand techniques (pressed position, left finger, left-hand playing technique for pitch variation, left-hand playing technique for timbre variation).
- **Audio annotations:** The folder “performance_annotation” contains note-by-note annotations of 39 audio clips corresponding to 31 sections in scores (some sections in scores are performed twice in the actual performance). Considering that the playing techniques applied in the actual performance may be different from those annotated in the scores, in this folder, the right-hand technique and left-hand technique annotations are labelled according to the specific performance version in the list above.
